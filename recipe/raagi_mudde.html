                    <li>Firstly, in a small bowl take 2 tbsp ragi flour from 1 cup of flour. we will be using the remaining flour later.</li>
                    <li>Add ¼ cup water and prepare a smooth lump-free batter. keep aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large vessel take 1¾ cup water, ¼ tsp salt, and ½ tsp ghee.</li>
                    <li>Add in the prepared ragi flour mixture and stir continuously.</li>
                    <li>Stir until the mixture thickens and turns glossy, ensuring there are no lumps.</li>
                    <li>Once the mixture turns glossy, add the remaining ragi flour. Make sure to spread and put the flour.</li>
                    <li>Do not touch the flour for 2 minutes and keep the flame on low.</li>
                    <li>Slightly spread the flour and allow it to boil for 5 minutes. Do not touch as there are chances for lumps to form.</li>
                    <li>Now take a wooden stick or rolling pin, and mix continuously. Stir until the mixture comes together.</li>
                    <li>Cover and simmer for 3 minutes or until the mixture turns glossy.</li>
                    <li>Give a good mix again and make sure to check the mixture is non-sticky, indicating the flour is cooked well.</li>
                    <li>Cool slightly, and take a ball-sized mixture into ghee greased bowl. Using a bowl makes it easy to handle the heat and can be shaped easily.</li>
