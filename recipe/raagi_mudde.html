                    <li>3 cups (16 ounces) strawberries, hulled and sliced or diced
                    </li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
                    <li>2 3/4 cups heavy cream</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>A few drops red food coloring, optional</li>

           <h1> Steps to Make It</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.
                <li>In a medium bowl combine the strawberries with the lemon juice and 1/2 cup of the sugar. Gently stir. Let stand at room temperature to allow the strawberries to release their juices, about 2 hours.
                <li>Strain the berries, reserving the accumulated juices.
                <li>Divide the berries in half. Mash or puree half of the berries and set aside. Refrigerate the remaining cut berries—they will be added later.
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine the milk and the remaining 1 cup of sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
                <li>Stir in the heavy cream, the reserved strawberry juice, the mashed strawberries, and the vanilla extract. This ice cream will have a natural appearance of a very pale pink. If a deeper pink hue is desired, add a few drops of red food coloring.
                <li>Churn the ice cream according to the manufacturer’s directions, about 20 to 25 minutes.
                <li>5 minutes before churning time ends, add the reserved sliced strawberries and mix until well combined. If using a small ice cream maker, add the reserved berries to an airtight, freezer-safe container with the churned ice cream. Gently stir until well combined.
                <li>Freezer for at least 2 hours to firm before scooping and serving.
